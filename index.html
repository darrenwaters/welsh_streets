<p>Almost half of all street names in Wales are in English with no Welsh translation or equivalent, analysis reveals.</p>
    <p>Welsh-only street names, with no English equivalent, account for fewer than one in five streets (18%), the deep-dive into Wales’ more than 48,000 names streets shows.</p>
              <p>Street naming is the responsibility of Wales’ 22 local authorities and since 2015 many have adopted a bilingual policy in place for new street names to meet the Well-being of Future Generations Act which has the goal of a thriving Welsh language.</p>
              <p>But analysis shows many new streets are still being named in English only.</p>
              <p>The numbers reflects Wales' less than straightforward relationship to the Welsh language. Twenty eight percent of the population speaks the language according to the <a href="https://gov.wales/welsh-language-data-annual-population-survey-april-2019-march-2020#:~:text=For%20the%20year%20ending%2031,equating%20to%2042%2C900%20fewer%20people.">2020 Annual Population Survey</a> and the country's government has a goal of raising that to one-third, more than a million people, by 2050.</p>
              
              <p>Across the country bilingual place signs are common, recognising the legal protections given to the language over the last 60-plus years, many of which were the result of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/gallery/6270052">pressure from those fighting to keep the language alive</a>.</p>
    
             <p>Wales' history and heritage can be seen not just in place names, but also in the streets of the country.</p>
              
              <p>From <i>Heol Pen Rhiw'r Eglwys</i>, meaning Church at the top of the slope Road, near Blackwood in Caerphilly to <i>Hen Ffordd Mwynglawdd</i>, which translated means Old Mine Road but in English is known only as Old Road, streets can reflect centuries of history and important events in time, but  sometimes that history can also be lost in translation.</p>
              
              <h4>The evocative and the mundane</h4>
              
              <p>For every evocative street name in Wales there are many more mundane, prosaic names.</p>
              
              <p>The most commonly used street names in Wales - <i>High Street</i> (201 occurrences), <i>Station Road</i> (164), <i>Church Street</i> (128), <i>Bridge Street</i> (96), <i>New Road</i>(94) - could as likely be found in any region or county of England.</p>               
                <p>And it is not as though the Welsh language is immune from the literal; the most common street names in Welsh across the country are <i>Stryd Fawr "Large Street"</i> (68 occurrences), <i>Pen y Bryn "Top of the hill"</i> (27), <i>Ffordd Newydd "New Road"</i> (27) and <i>Stryd y Eglwys "Church Street"</i> (26).</p>
              
              <p>However, analysis of all streets across the country reveals just how the political and cultural landscape of an area can impact the visibility of Welsh in the places people live.</p>
              
              <p>Analysis of more than 48,000 streets in Wales showed:<br></p>
              
<p>Forty-eight per cent of all street names in Wales are only in English, despite decades of bilingualism at the centre of Welsh life, and in total 52% of all street names contain no Welsh language element at all.</p>
<p>Just 6% are completely bilingual, where there is an English and a Welsh version for all elements of the street name.</p>
              <p>More than half of all street names in 10 out of the 21 local authorities were in English only, the analysis revealed. In three counties — Newport, Pembrokeshire and Monmouthshire — more than 75% of all streets were English-only, reflecting both the geography and history of those counties, which have traditionally been seen as anglo-centric and have relatively low numbers of Welsh speakers historically.</p>

          <br>
            <p>Street naming policies highlighting a local authority’s approach to planning were available online only in 15 of the 22 local authorities, research showed.</p>
              <p>Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire, Torfaen and the Vale of Glamorgan did not provide easily obtainable guidance on street naming conventions.
Among the remaining 15, there were different approaches being taken to street naming:
</p><br>
             <ul>  <li style="color:black;font-size:18px">Four counties have a Welsh-only policy – Bridgend, Ceredigion, Anglesey, Rhondda Cynon Taf</li>
              <li style="color:black;font-size:18px">Nine  counties have a bilingual policy unless Welsh is proposed – Wrexham, Monmouthshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Gwynedd, Flintshire, Denbighshire, Conwy, Cardiff, Powys</li>
              <li style="color:black;font-size:18px">One local authority has a policy of either Welsh or English with no translations – Swansea</li>
               <li style="color:black;font-size:18px">One local authority has a policy of having both Welsh and English street names – Newport</li>
                      
         </ul> 
          
    
              <p>In its report into a  strategic approach to naming streets, Wales' biggest local authority Cardiff said in 2019: "Street naming is also a key element of place-making…</p>
              <p><i>"Ensuring that the naming of new streets in Cardiff reflects local heritage, with names for new developments which are historically, culturally and linguistically linked, will help to deliver on the national well-being goal, 'A Wales of vibrant culture and thriving Welsh Language'."</i></p>
              <h4>Disproportionate volume</h4><br>
              <p>However, initial analysis of streets across Wales registered in the last two full years (2019 and 2020) shows 27% were in English only, despite the legislation requiring a Welsh language equivalent. In Cardiff County Council 6% of streets registered in those years appeared to have no Welsh language element, in contrast to their own strategy.</p>
              <p>Further analysis is needed given the time lag between the development of new streets and the registration on the national gazette of street names, as well as acknowledged issues with the accuracy of timestamps used by GeoPlace, the company which maintains the register.</p>
              <p>Across Wales' 21 local authorities there are no plans to add Welsh language versions of existing street names despite the disproportionate volume of English-only street names, analysis of publicly-available policy documents across the counties showed.</p>
              <p>In its street naming strategy, Cardiff Council said: "Existing street names will remain in the 'known' existing language to mitigate potential confusion (e.g. English only or Welsh only). This removes the need for English to Welsh and Welsh to English translations for street names."</p>
              <p> Atittudes to the value of Welsh street names is mixed across local authorities. In <a href="https://www.denbighshire.gov.uk/en/documents/planning-and-building-regulations/ldp/supplementary-planning-guidance/adopted-spg-documents/planning-and-the-welsh-language.pdf">its guidance</a>, Denbighshire council says: "The planning system cannot be viewed as a panacea to arrest the decline of
the Welsh language."</p>
              <p>In Anglesey there is a <a href="http://democracy.anglesey.gov.uk/documents/s9772/Street%20and%20House%20Naming%20and%20Numbering%20Policy.pdf?LLL=0">contrasting view:</a> "Preserving native and historical Welsh names along with adopting new Welsh
names is an important contribution towards preserving and promoting this
linguistic identity for the future." </p>
              <h4>Historic origins</h4>
              <br>
              <p>Cardiff's city council has a goal of parity between English and Welsh street names in the future. Council leader Huw Thomas told a cabinet meeting when its street naming policy was launched in 2019: "We know Cardiff is growing and this will make sure the streets reflect the historic origins of these areas."</p>
              <p>Yet analysis showed that in the city as of the end of 2020, just 16% of street names were either fully bilingual or completely in Welsh, while 56% were completely in English.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It's a similar picture across Wales' largest towns and cities: English-only street names tend to dominate.</p>
